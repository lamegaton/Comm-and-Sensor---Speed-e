Please take a look and build our wiki page https://github.com/lamegaton/Comm-and-Sensor---Speed-e/wiki
# Power
1. library we are using: https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power


# Sensor
1. confidence level of car is around **5-7**
2. our max distance is 14 feet from the curve to the first white stripe line
3. on **04/18/2019**, we remove calibration code because it's not important
4. change **trig time to 20s and echo to 2s**


# Communication
1. planning to use different spreading factor for diffrent node
2. We've trying to get the downlink from TTN from node 
3. For testing and increase the range, we set the gateway to single channel and single Spreading factor (10)
4. 

## Location
1. Node 1: 
32°46'43.9"N 117°04'23.6"W  
32.778863, -117.073228

## Notes for team:
1. Please write code in block or function so we can easily intergrate
2. we have only 18 days left babes!
3. If you want to upload a new code with lmic, you have to change NWKey and APPKey
